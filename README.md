In this project I use SQL solving case studies created by Danny Ma. 
I use PostgreSQL for these tasks.

The tasks presented on the aforementioned page allow me to develop my SQL skills.

## SQL skills gained
- Aggregations
- Joins
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK)
- CASE WHEN statments
- Subqueries

### Case Study Questions:
* What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
* How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
* What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
* What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
* Which item was the most popular for each customer?
* Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
* Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
* What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
* If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
* In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
